## What is RektHub?

RektHub is a **creator-token economy hub** that eliminates blockchain boundaries. We're not just another token launchpad, we're building infrastructure that empowers creators to build, monetize, and engage with communities across any chain.

Every chain today operates as an isolated island. Ethereum creators can't easily reach Solana users. Base tokens can't tap into Arbitrum liquidity. Communities are fragmented by the chains they're on. **RektHub changes this.**

## The Vision

Imagine launching a token on Base and having someone on Solana buy it with SOL in one click. No wrapped tokens, no friction. Your community united across chains, trading together, growing together. That's RektHub.

## Why RektHub?

### For Creators

Launch your token on any chain, accumulate fees from every buy and sell, and control where your token graduates to. Even better sustainable creator economics (more in future).

<Tip>
	Creators earn **30% of all trading fees** plus **60% of the migration fee**
	when their token graduates to a DEX.
</Tip>

### For Communities

Trade from any chain using the natives of that chain. Built-in **Rekt Community chat** keeps everyone connected. Real-time activity feeds show what's happening. Your community isn't limited by which wallet you have.

### For Integrators

Contract is open source. Build dashboards, aggregators, bots, or full platforms on top of RektHub's infrastructure.

## What Makes Us Different

This isn't another pump-and-dump factory. RektHub uses proven **bonding curve mechanics** with fair launch guarantees. Creators don't get special allocations. Everyone buys from the same curve.

<Info>
	When **850 million tokens are sold**, your token graduates to a real DEX with
	deep liquidity automatically.
</Info>

Beyond tokens, we're building the full creator economy stack: monetization tools, engagement features, and utilities that empower creators without compromising their communities.

<Tip>More features coming soon. We're just getting started.</Tip>
