## Overview

RektHub's fee model aligns incentives between creators, communities, and the platform. No hidden charges, no surprise deductions—everything is transparent and on-chain.

## Trading Fees (1% Total)

Every buy and sell on RektHub incurs a **1% fee**. This fee is split between creator and platform.

### Creator Share: 30%

As a creator, you earn **30% of every trading fee** on your token. These fees accumulate in your bonding curve contract and can be claimed anytime.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title='How It Works'>
		```javascript
		// User buys $1,000 worth of your token
		const tradeAmount = 1000;
		const totalFee = tradeAmount * 0.01;  // $10
		
		// Fee split
		const yourShare = totalFee * 0.30;      // $3 (30%)
		const platformShare = totalFee * 0.70;  // $7 (70%)
		
		// Your $3 accumulates in curve
		accumulatedCreatorFees += yourShare;
		```
	</Tab>

    <Tab title='Claim Anytime'>
    	Fees don't transfer immediately—they accumulate to save gas. Call `claimCreatorFees()` whenever you want to withdraw.

    	```javascript
    	// Check accumulated fees
    	const [creator, fees] = await curve.getCreatorInfo();
    	console.log(`Claimable: ${ethers.formatEther(fees)} ETH`);

    	// Claim when ready
    	await curve.claimCreatorFees();
    	```

    	**No limits:** Claim once, claim daily, claim after bonding—it's your choice. No waiting periods, no restrictions.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title='Example Earnings'>
    	Track potential earnings at different volume levels:

    	| Daily Volume | Trading Fees (1%) | Your Share (30%) | Monthly Earnings |
    	|--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
    	| $1,000 | $10 | $3 | $90 |
    	| $10,000 | $100 | $30 | $900 |
    	| $50,000 | $500 | $150 | $4,500 |
    	| $100,000 | $1,000 | $300 | $9,000 |
    	| $500,000 | $5,000 | $1,500 | $45,000 |
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Platform Share: 70%

The platform takes **70% of trading fees** to sustain infrastructure:

	Trading fees fund everything. Aligned incentives—we only succeed when you

## Creation Fees

Launching a token costs a **one-time creation fee**. This fee varies by chain to account for different gas costs and economic conditions.

### Current Fees by Chain

<Tabs>
	<Tab title='EVM Chains'>
		| Chain | Creation Fee | USD Equivalent* |
		|-------|--------------|-----------------|
		| Ethereum | 0.05 ETH | ~$150 |
		| Base | 0.01 ETH | ~$30 |
		| Arbitrum | 0.01 ETH | ~$30 |
		| Polygon | 20 MATIC | ~$20 |
		| BSC | 0.1 BNB | ~$60 |
		| Zircuit | 0.01 ETH | ~$30 |
		| Linea | 0.01 ETH | ~$30 |
		
		*USD values are approximate and vary with market prices
	</Tab>

    <Tab title='Coming Soon'>
    	| Chain | Estimated Fee | Status |
    	|-------|---------------|--------|
    	| Solana | 0.5 SOL | Q1 2025 |
    	| Avalanche | 1 AVAX | Q1 2025 |
    	| Optimism | 0.01 ETH | Q2 2025 |
    	| Sui | TBD | Q2 2025 |

### What Creation Fees Cover

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card

		Deploy with minimal gas using clone pattern

### Why Creation Fees?

<Accordion title='Prevents Spam'>
	Without creation fees, anyone could deploy thousands of tokens for pennies and
	clog the platform with scams.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Ensures Serious Creators'>
	The fee acts as "skin in the game"—creators who pay are more likely to build
	genuine communities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Funds Initial Infrastructure'>
	Covers gas costs, indexing, and setup that happens before any trading fees are
	generated.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
	**Fees are non-refundable.** Make sure you're ready to commit to your token
	before launching.
</Warning>

## Migration Fees (12% of Liquidity)

When your token graduates to a DEX, RektHub charges a **12% fee** on the total liquidity being migrated. This fee rewards creators and sustains platform development.

### Creator Share: 60%

You get **60% of the migration fee**. This is a significant reward for building an active community that reached bonding.

<Steps>
	<Step title='Token Bonds'>
		850M tokens sold, curve has accumulated liquidity (e.g., 500 ETH)
	</Step>
	<Step title='Migration Fee Calculated'>12% of 500 ETH = 60 ETH total fee</Step>
	<Step title='You Get 60%'>
		60% of 60 ETH = 36 ETH added to your claimable fees
	</Step>
	<Step title='Platform Gets 40%'>
		40% of 60 ETH = 24 ETH sustains migration infrastructure
	</Step>
	<Step title='Liquidity to DEX'>
		440 ETH + 150M tokens create the liquidity pool
	</Step>
</Steps>

**Example Migration Fee Breakdown (500 ETH bonding):**

| Component         | Amount                    | Percentage | USD Value\*    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Total Liquidity   | 500 ETH                   | 100%       | $1,500,000     |
| **Migration Fee** | **60 ETH**                | **12%**    | **$180,000**   |
| └─ Creator Gets   | 36 ETH                    | 60% of fee | $108,000       |
| └─ Platform Gets  | 24 ETH                    | 40% of fee | $72,000        |
| **To DEX**        | **440 ETH + 150M tokens** | **88%**    | **$1,320,000** |

\*Assumes ETH @ $3,000

<Tip>
	**Why 60% to creator?** Getting to bonding (850M tokens sold) means you built
	real demand. You earned this through community engagement, marketing, and
	delivering value.
</Tip>

### Platform Share: 40%

Platform takes **40% of migration fees** to fund:

## Fee Comparison

### RektHub vs Traditional Launches

**Cost comparison for launching a token:**

| Method        | Upfront Cost              | Creator Earnings                  | Community Trust                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **RektHub**   | $30-150 creation fee      | 30% of trading + 60% of migration | ✅ High (fair launch)             |
| DEX Listing   | $50K-$500K                | 0% (unless you keep tokens)       | ⚠️ Medium (depends on tokenomics) |
| Market Makers | 10-20% of supply          | Depends on deal                   | ❌ Low (insider advantages)       |
| ICO/Presale   | $100K+ (legal, marketing) | Varies widely                     | ❌ Low (insider allocations)      |

<Info>
	**RektHub advantage:** Pay once, earn forever. No upfront capital, no supply
	giveaways, just sustainable creator economics.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Can I change fee percentages for my token?">
		No, fees are hardcoded in the smart contracts to ensure consistency and trust. All tokens follow the same fee structure.
	</Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What if I don't claim my fees before migration?">
    	No problem! Your accumulated fees stay in the curve contract forever. Claim whenever you want, even years after migration.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Do I pay gas for fee accumulation?">
    	No! Fees accumulate in the curve contract. You only pay gas when you claim them.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why is the migration fee so high (12%)?">
    	The 12% fee is substantial but fair:
    	- You get 60% of it (7.2% of total liquidity)
    	- It rewards successful community building
    	- Still leaves 88% for deep DEX liquidity
    	- Industry standard: most DEX launches cost 10-30% in various fees
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I avoid the migration fee?">
    	No, the fee is charged automatically when migrating. But remember: you get 60% of it, so it's actually a reward for your success!
    </Accordion>
