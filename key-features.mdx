## Cross-Chain Infrastructure

### One-Click Trading From Anywhere

Launch a token on any chain. Anyone can buy it from any other chain using their native crypto. No wrapped tokens, no multi-step processes.

### Fair Launch Mechanics

Every token starts from the same place. No pre-sales, no insider allocations, no team tokens.

<CodeGroup>

```solidity Token Distribution
totalSupply = 1,000,000,000 tokens

// Distribution at launch
creatorAllocation = 0 tokens        // Creator gets ZERO
teamAllocation = 0 tokens            // Team gets ZERO
tradeableSupply = 850,000,000 tokens // On bonding curve
reservedForDEX = 150,000,000 tokens  // For graduation

// Everyone buys from the curve
```

```javascript Fair Launch Guarantee
const fairLaunchRules = {
	creatorAdvantage: false,
	insiderAccess: false,
	specialAllocations: false,
	everyonePays: 'same price at same time',
};
```

</CodeGroup>

### Deterministic Vanity Addresses

Want your token at a specific address? Use CREATE2 for vanity addresses.

<Steps>
	<Step title='Mine Salt Off-Chain'>
		Use a mining tool to find a salt that produces your desired address pattern
	</Step>
	<Step title='Deploy Deterministically'>
		Call `createTokenDeterministic()` with your mined salt
	</Step>
	<Step title='Get Vanity Address'>
		Your token deploys at the exact address you wanted
	</Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Example: Mining for 0xDEAD prefix">

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for mining
function mineVanitySalt(desiredPrefix) {
	let salt = 0;
	while (true) {
		const predictedAddress = predictAddress(salt);
		if (predictedAddress.startsWith(desiredPrefix)) {
			return salt;
		}
		salt++;
	}
}

const salt = mineVanitySalt('0xDEAD');
await factory.createTokenDeterministic(name, symbol, uri, salt);
```

</Accordion>

## Creator Economics

### Accumulate Trading Fees

Earn 30% of all trading fees from your token. Fees accumulate in your bonding curve contract, claim anytime.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Fee Calculation
// On every trade
const tradingFee = tradeAmount * 0.01; // 1% total fee
const creatorShare = tradingFee * 0.3; // 30% to you
const platformShare = tradingFee * 0.7; // 70% to platform

// Accumulates in your curve
accumulatedCreatorFees += creatorShare;
```

```javascript Example Earnings
// Your token does $100,000 in volume
const volume = 100000;
const totalFees = volume * 0.01; // $1,000
const yourEarnings = totalFees * 0.3; // $300

// Claim anytime
await bondingCurve.claimCreatorFees();
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
	**No waiting periods.** Claim once, claim daily, claim after bonding, it's your
	choice.
</Tip>

### Migration Rewards

When your token graduates to a DEX, you earn 60% of the 12% migration fee.

<Steps>
	<Step title='Token Bonds (850M sold)'>
		Your curve has accumulated liquidity (e.g., 5 ETH)
	</Step>
	<Step title='Migration Fee Charged'>
		12% of liquidity = 0.6 ETH migration fee
	</Step>
	<Step title='You Get 60%'>
		60% of 0.6 ETH = 0.36 ETH (~$1,080) added to your claimable fees
	</Step>
	<Step title='Platform Gets 40%'>
		40% of 0.6 ETH = 0.24 ETH sustains migration infrastructure
	</Step>
</Steps>

**Example: 5 ETH bonding liquidity**

| Component              | Amount                | USD Value (ETH @ $3,000) |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Total Liquidity        | 5 ETH                 | $15,000                  |
| Migration Fee (12%)    | 0.6 ETH               | $1,800                   |
| **Creator Gets (60%)** | **0.36 ETH**          | **$1,080**               |
| Platform Gets (40%)    | 0.24 ETH              | $720                     |
| To DEX                 | 4.4 ETH + 150M tokens | $13,200                  |

## Technical Features

### Gas-Optimized Clone Pattern

Each token deployment uses minimal gas through OpenZeppelin's clone pattern.

```solidity
// One implementation deployed
tokenImplementation = new RektHubToken();
curveImplementation = new BondingCurve();

// Thousands of tokens deployed as clones
for (each token launch) {
  token = Clones.clone(tokenImplementation);  // ~cheap gas
  curve = Clones.clone(curveImplementation);  // ~cheap gas
}

// vs deploying fresh contracts (~expensive gas each)
```

<Tip>
	**Why it matters:** Cheaper launches = more creators = more opportunities for
	everyone.
</Tip>

### Isolated Bonding Curves

Every token gets its own trading contract. No shared state, no cross-contamination.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title='Isolated Architecture'>
		```
		Token A -> Curve A -> Reserves A -> Fees A
		Token B -> Curve B -> Reserves B -> Fees B
		Token C -> Curve C -> Reserves C -> Fees C
		```
		
		Each curve is completely independent. A bug in one doesn't affect others. Although, for simplicity, you can invoke buy and sell methods on a known curve from the main factory
	</Tab>

    <Tab title='Benefits'>
    	- **Security:** Isolated risk per token
    	- **Simplicity:** One curve, one token, clear logic
    	- **Flexibility:** Each curve can be customized
    	- **Scalability:** Add tokens without affecting existing ones
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Proven AMM Mechanics

Constant product formula (x × y = k) with virtual reserves for instant price discovery without requiring creators to add liquidity.

```javascript
// Standard AMM (requires real liquidity)
realX * realY = k

// RektHub uses virtual reserves
virtualX * virtualY = k

// Enables trading from day one with zero liquidity seeded
```

<Accordion title="Why virtual reserves?">
Virtual reserves enable **instant trading without requiring creators to provide liquidity**.

**Traditional DEX approach:**

- Creator must seed liquidity pool (e.g., 100 ETH + 1B tokens)
- Requires significant upfront capital
- Creator takes on impermanent loss risk

**RektHub approach:**

- Virtual reserves create pricing formula from launch
- First buyer: Gets 35M tokens for 0.1 ETH (price calculated from virtuals)
- Second buyer: Gets 33M tokens for 0.1 ETH (stable progression)
- No liquidity needed - the curve IS the market maker

**The math:**

```javascript
// At launch (no real liquidity seeded)
virtualNativeReserves = 1.5 ETH    // Virtual, not real
virtualTokenReserves = 1.073B      // Virtual, not real
realNativeReserves = 0             // Actually zero!
realTokenReserves = 850M           // Real tokens available

// Price still calculable from virtuals
price = virtualNative / virtualToken
```

Virtual reserves eliminate the need for liquidity pools during the bonding phase. The curve itself provides liquidity using the constant product formula, with liquidity only forming for DEX graduation once 850M tokens are sold.

</Accordion>

### Creator Fee Claims

Claim your accumulated fees anytime. No waiting periods, no restrictions.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Check Fees
const [creator, accumulatedFees] = await curve.getCreatorInfo();
console.log(`Claimable: ${ethers.formatEther(accumulatedFees)} ETH`);
```

```javascript Claim Fees
const tx = await curve.claimCreatorFees();
await tx.wait();
console.log('Fees claimed!');
```

</CodeGroup>

### Token Metadata URIs

Update your token's metadata anytime as creator.

```javascript
// Metadata JSON structure
{
  "name": "Creator Token",
  "description": "Token for my community",
  "image": "ipfs://...",
  "external_url": "https://myproject.com",
  "socials": {
    "twitter": "https://x.com/myproject",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/myproject",
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/myproject"
  }
}

// Update URI
await token.setTokenURI("ipfs://new-metadata-hash");
```
