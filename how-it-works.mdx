## The RektHub Flow

RektHub creates a seamless journey from token creation to community-driven trading to DEX graduation. Here's how the pieces fit together:

<Steps>
	<Step title='Creator Launches Token'>
		Pay a one-time fee, launch your token on any supported chain in minutes
	</Step>
	<Step title='Community Trades Cross-Chain'>
		Anyone buys from anywhere using their native crypto
	</Step>
	<Step title='Token Graduates to DEX'>
		After 850M tokens sold, migrate to a major DEX with deep liquidity
	</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 1. Creator Launches Token

A creator pays a one-time platform fee and launches their token on any supported chain—Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, wherever their community lives. The process takes minutes, no code required.

</Frame>

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title='1 billion tokens minted'>
		Total supply minted to an isolated bonding curve contract. No team tokens, no
		pre-sales.
	</Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Virtual liquidity activated'>
    	Virtual reserves (1.073B tokens + native) enable smooth price discovery from
    	day one.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Token becomes tradeable'>
    	Immediate trading starts. No waiting for liquidity providers or market makers.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Creator fee accumulation begins'>
    	30% of every trading fee starts accumulating for the creator.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Fair Launch Guarantee

<Warning>
	**The creator gets zero tokens upfront.** Everyone, including the creator, buys
	from the same bonding curve. No special allocations, no insider advantages.
</Warning>

```solidity
// At launch
totalSupply = 1,000,000,000 tokens
tradeableSupply = 850,000,000 tokens (on curve)
reservedSupply = 150,000,000 tokens (for DEX graduation)

creatorBalance = 0 tokens (must buy like everyone else)
```

## 2. Community Trades Cross-Chain

This is where RektHub shines. Your token lives on Base, but someone on Solana wants in? They buy with SOL. Someone on Arbitrum? They use ETH. **RektHub's intent-based routing handles everything.**

## 3. Token Graduates to DEX

When **850 million tokens are sold** from the bonding curve, your token is ready to graduate. The creator controls where it goes, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, any supported DEX.

### What Happens at Graduation (Assuming 500 ETH accumulated, exaggerated figures)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Curve as Bonding Curve
    participant System as RektHub System
    participant Factory as RektHub Factory
    participant Migrator as DEX Migrator
    participant DEX as DEX Platform
    participant Pool as Liquidity Pool

    Note over Curve: 850M tokens sold (Bonding achieved)
    Curve->>Curve: Set status to "bonded"
    Note over Curve: Trading stops on curve

    System->>Factory: Detect bonding event
    Factory->>Curve: Trigger migrate(migrator)

    Curve->>Curve: Calculate migration fees (12%)
    Curve->>Curve: Split: 60% creator, 40% platform
    Curve->>Curve: Add creator fee to accumulatedCreatorFees
    Curve->>Factory: Send 40% platform fee

    Note over Curve: Creator can claim 60% anytime

    Curve->>Migrator: Send liquidity (440 ETH + 150M tokens)

    Note over Migrator: Creator's chosen DEX platform
    Migrator->>DEX: Create pool with liquidity
    DEX->>Pool: Initialize LP
    Pool->>Pool: Mint LP tokens
    Pool->>Pool: Lock/burn LP tokens
    DEX-->>Migrator: Return pool address
    Migrator-->>Curve: Return (poolAddress, platformName)

    Curve->>Curve: Set status to "graduated"
    Note over Pool: Token now tradeable on DEX

    opt Creator claims fees later
        Note over Curve: Creator calls claimCreatorFees()
        Curve->>Curve: Transfer accumulated fees to creator
    end
```

<Steps>
	<Step title='Migration Fee Charged'>
		12% of liquidity taken as fee (60% to creator, 40% to platform)
	</Step>
	<Step title='Liquidity Migrated'>
		Remaining 150M tokens + accumulated native sent to DEX
	</Step>
	<Step title='LP Created'>
		Liquidity pool created automatically, LP tokens locked/burned
	</Step>
	<Step title='Price Discovery'>
		Immediate buying pressure often creates 5-10x gains for early buyers
	</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
	**Example:** 500 ETH accumulated → 60 ETH migration fee → Creator gets 36 ETH →
	440 ETH + 150M tokens to DEX
</Info>

### The Price Bump (IYKYK)

When 150M tokens hit the DEX against hundreds of ETH in liquidity, there's an immediate price bump. Early bonding curve buyers often see **3-5x gains** at graduation.

**Why the mathematical advantage?**

The DEX pool starts with fundamentally better economics than the bonding curve:

- **Scarcity effect**: Only 150M tokens on pool (vs 850M that were sold on curve)
- **Same liquidity base**: All accumulated ETH from selling 850M tokens (minus 12% fee)
- **Better ratio**: Fewer tokens against the same liquidity = higher price floor
- **Supply shock**: 85% of supply already distributed, only 15% in the pool

**The Math:**

```
Bonding Curve at completion:
- 850M tokens sold for ~500 ETH
- Final price: ~$0.0000018 per token

DEX Pool at launch:
- 150M tokens paired with ~440 ETH (88% of accumulated liquidity)
- Initial price: ~$0.0000088 per token
- That's ~4.9x higher due to the improved token-to-ETH ratio
```

The graduation pump isn't hype, it's supply and demand fundamentals resetting with better parameters.

## The Creator Economy Loop

This loop sustains itself without extractive tactics:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Creator Launches] --> B[Earns 30% of Fees]
    B --> C[Community Grows]
    C --> D[More Trading Volume]
    D --> B
    D --> E[Token Bonds]
    E --> F[Graduates to DEX]
    F --> G[Creator Claims Fees]
    G --> H[Reinvests in Community]
    H --> C
```

<Note>**Creator success = Community success = Platform success**</Note>
